- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [cstaaben/erebor](https://github.com/cstaaben/erebor).
  
  This is a roguelike written in Go, inspired by the early roguelike Moria. It's my first dedicated foray into game design, and I'm loving the
  challenges so far. You can follow along in my [blog series](https://cstaaben.github.io/tags/roguelike/).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning rust and Godot!
